title: Information Distribution

<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>The purpose of information distribution is to efficiently complete a project that require interaction of many individuals as well as tracking the status of a project and the contributions made so far to it.</p>

<h1>Technologies</h1>
<p>The technologies usually involved in information distribution are</p>
<p>
<li>source repository browser
<li>mailing lists
<li>online postings (wiki, blog, etc.)
<li>mechanically generated reports (build, tests, etc.)
<li>notification mechanism
<li>tracking developer contributions (hour logs, bug trackers, etc.)
<li>online calendars and schedules
</p>

<h1>Features</h1>
<p>To distribute information efficiently, the support technologies should have the following features</p>
<p>
<li>Single sign-on
<li>One page management of user accessibility rights
<li>Automated integration of mechanically generated reports
<li>Mechanically generated reports through intelligent data mining (ex. graphs with number of commits per days vs. unit tests passing)
<li>Search engine through all postings, code, wiki, etc. With an efficient search engine, it could go as far as marking documents with special <i>todo</i> tags instead of relying on a bug tracking system.
<li>Links between source code and documentation files. That is a url in a source comment should be traversable and documentation files could have url to source code files.
<li>Collaborative drawing whiteboard
<li>Import/export of documents from/to standard formats (.sxc, .pdf, etc.)
<li>Context sensitive integrated &quot;educational notes&quot; on how use the information distribution system.
</p>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>HTML remains central for presentation of a web interface and PDF remains central for printed documentation. As a result, content is usually stored in a server repository as a presentation independent file which is processed by appropriate transformation tools on request.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.docbook.org/tdg5/en/html/docbook.html">DocBook</a> is a popular format to store documentation content. When the documentation is embed into source code comments, tools such as <a href="http://www.dbdoclet.org/">dbdoclet</a> can be used to extract it into a docbook document.</p>
<p>The XSL language and XSL processors (ex. <a href="http://xml.apache.org/xalan-c/index.html">Xalan</a>) are typically used to transform XML documents in general. DocBook documents can be turned into either HTML or PDF through XSL based <a href="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/">docbook tools</a>. Using directly an XML parser (ex. <a href="http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/">RapidXML</a>), PDF C++ libraries (ex. <a href="http://www.jagpdf.com/">JagPDF</a>), custom tools can also be implemented to transform content documents. The result can be served directly to the client or some sort of caching framework (ex. <a href="http://murka.sourceforge.net/">Murka</a>, <a href="http://axkit.org/">Apache AxKit</a>) can be used to handle requests more efficiently.</p>
<p>When presented as a website, the resulting HTML pages will further be customized with a specific company look and feel through CSS style-sheets.</p> 
<p>Web 2.0 technologies enable contributors to use a web browser as a text editor to create and modify remote files stored on a server. Heavy client-side Javascript are involved to implement full editors (ex. <a href="http://www.freedomeditor.com/">Freedom editor</a>, <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/">TinyMCE</a>) and other UI interactions such as <a href="http://www.walterzorn.com/dragdrop/dragdrop_e.htm">Javascript Drag-n-Drop</a> (<a href="http://www.webreference.com/programming/javascript/mk/column2/">second example</a>). HTTP extension protocols such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a>, a "Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning", allow contributors to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote web servers and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> is a popular standard for notification of website updates.</p>

<p>Fortylines solutions server infrastructure is based on common open source <a href="services.book">services</a> and a custom simple-to-deploy <a href="/seed/index.book">presentation back-end</a> that strive to address features required for communication on software development projects.</p>
